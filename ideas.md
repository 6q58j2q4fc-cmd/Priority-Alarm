## Idea 1: "High Desert Modernism"

**Design Movement:** Desert Modernism meets Pacific Northwest Craft - inspired by the architectural language of the homes themselves: glass, timber, stone against high desert landscapes.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Horizontal Emphasis** - Mirroring the prairie-style rooflines and expansive mountain views
2. **Material Honesty** - Digital textures that evoke wood grain, stone, and glass
3. **Negative Space as Landscape** - Using whitespace like the open high desert
4. **Warm Neutrality** - Earth tones punctuated by sunset amber accents

**Color Philosophy:** 
- Primary: Charred timber (#2C2416) - warmth and craftsmanship
- Secondary: Desert sage (#A8B5A0) - natural Central Oregon palette
- Accent: Alpenglow amber (#D4915A) - sunset over the Cascades
- Background: Warm cream (#F7F5F0) - like natural light through glass walls
- Text: Deep slate (#1A1A1A) on light, warm white on dark sections

**Layout Paradigm:** 
Asymmetric grid with dramatic full-bleed hero sections. Content blocks offset like architectural floor plans. Sticky navigation that transforms on scroll. Parallax mountain silhouettes creating depth.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Diagonal section dividers mimicking rooflines
2. Floating image galleries with subtle shadow depth
3. Topographic line patterns as decorative backgrounds

**Interaction Philosophy:** 
Smooth, confident transitions like opening a well-crafted door. Hover states reveal depth. Scroll-triggered animations that feel architectural - elements sliding into place like precision joinery.

**Animation:**
- Hero text fades in with slight upward drift (0.8s ease-out)
- Images scale from 1.02 to 1.0 on load
- Section reveals with staggered children (50ms delay each)
- Buttons have subtle lift on hover with shadow expansion

**Typography System:**
- Display: Playfair Display (serif) - elegant, established, timeless
- Body: Source Sans Pro - clean, readable, professional
- Accent: Letter-spaced uppercase for labels and navigation

## Idea 2: "Cascade Editorial"

**Design Movement:** Editorial Luxury Magazine meets Real Estate Prestige - think Architectural Digest meets high-end property marketing.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Editorial Hierarchy** - Bold headlines, refined body copy, magazine-style layouts
2. **Photography-First** - Images as the hero, text as supporting cast
3. **Sophisticated Restraint** - Luxury through subtlety, not excess
4. **Vertical Rhythm** - Strong baseline grid creating visual order

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Deep forest (#1B3D2F) - Oregon pine forests
- Secondary: Warm stone (#C4B7A6) - natural building materials
- Accent: Copper (#B87333) - premium metallic touch
- Background: Off-white (#FAFAF8) - gallery wall neutral
- Dark sections: Rich charcoal (#1E1E1E) for contrast blocks

**Layout Paradigm:**
Magazine-style asymmetric columns. Large pull quotes. Full-width image breaks. Text wraps around floating elements. Alternating light/dark sections for rhythm.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Thin copper accent lines as dividers
2. Large drop caps on article openings
3. Circular image masks for testimonial portraits

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Refined and intentional. Hover reveals additional information. Click interactions feel decisive. Scrolling feels like turning magazine pages.

**Animation:**
- Text blocks reveal with clip-path wipe from left
- Images have subtle Ken Burns effect on scroll
- Navigation items have underline grow animation
- Cards lift with refined shadow on hover

**Typography System:**
- Display: Cormorant Garamond - editorial elegance
- Body: Inter - modern readability
- Accent: Bebas Neue for impact headlines

## Idea 3: "Artisan Craft"

**Design Movement:** Japanese Wabi-Sabi meets Northwest Craftsman - celebrating imperfection, natural materials, and handcrafted quality.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Organic Geometry** - Soft edges, natural curves, hand-drawn elements
2. **Textural Depth** - Paper textures, grain overlays, tactile surfaces
3. **Asymmetric Balance** - Intentionally imperfect but harmonious
4. **Warm Minimalism** - Sparse but never cold

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Weathered cedar (#6B4423) - aged wood warmth
- Secondary: River stone (#8B8B7A) - natural gray-green
- Accent: Lichen gold (#C9A227) - organic metallic
- Background: Handmade paper (#F5F2EB) with subtle texture
- Text: Ink black (#0D0D0D) - like brush strokes

**Layout Paradigm:**
Overlapping elements creating depth. Hand-drawn border frames. Content arranged like a curated gallery. Generous margins suggesting crafted intention.

**Signature Elements:**
1. Subtle paper grain texture overlay
2. Hand-drawn accent lines and borders
3. Organic blob shapes as section backgrounds

**Interaction Philosophy:**
Gentle and considered. Elements respond like natural materials - wood that warms to touch. Transitions feel organic, never mechanical.

**Animation:**
- Elements fade in with organic easing (cubic-bezier)
- Hover states have gentle scale and warmth shift
- Scroll reveals feel like unfolding paper
- Micro-interactions have slight bounce

**Typography System:**
- Display: Libre Baskerville - classic with character
- Body: Lato - friendly and approachable
- Accent: Hand-drawn style for special callouts

## Selected Approach: High Desert Modernism

I'm selecting **Idea 1: High Desert Modernism** as it best reflects the architectural style of Kevin Rea's work - the seamless blend of modern design with natural Central Oregon materials. The horizontal emphasis mirrors the homes' prairie-style rooflines, while the warm earth tones and alpenglow accents capture the region's distinctive sunset views over the Cascades.

This approach will create a website that feels like an extension of the homes themselves - sophisticated, warm, and deeply connected to the Central Oregon landscape.
