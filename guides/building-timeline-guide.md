## Factors That Affect Timeline

### Weather
Central Oregon winters can slow exterior work. Plan for potential delays from November through March.

### Material Lead Times
Custom items like windows, cabinetry, and specialty materials can have lead times of 8-16 weeks. Early ordering is essential.

### Decision Making
Delays in making selections or approving changes can extend the timeline. Stay engaged and make decisions promptly.

### Site Conditions
Unexpected rock, poor soil, or other site issues can add time to the foundation phase.

### Complexity
More complex designs with custom details take longer than simpler homes.

## Tips for Staying on Schedule

1. **Make decisions early:** Complete all selections before construction begins
2. **Stay engaged:** Attend weekly meetings and respond promptly to questions
3. **Avoid changes:** Changes during construction cause delays and cost increases
4. **Trust the process:** Your builder has done this many times
5. **Plan for contingencies:** Build buffer time into your move-out plans
