## What Makes a Great Custom Home Builder

### Experience and Track Record

A builder's experience directly impacts the quality of your home and the smoothness of the building process. Look for builders with a proven track record in your area and price range.

**Questions to Ask:**
- How many custom homes have you built?
- How long have you been building in Central Oregon?
- Can you provide references from recent clients?
- Have you built in my target community before?

**What to Look For:**
- 10+ years of custom home experience
- Portfolio of homes similar to your vision
- Experience with your chosen community's requirements
- Stable business history

### Financial Stability

Your builder needs to be financially stable to complete your project and honor warranties. Unfortunately, some builders take on too much work or underbid projects, leading to problems.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Can you provide bank and supplier references?
- What is your bonding capacity?
- How do you handle cost overruns?
- What payment schedule do you use?

**Red Flags:**
- Requests for large upfront payments
- Reluctance to provide references
- History of liens or lawsuits
- Unusually low bids

### Communication Style

Building a custom home requires constant communication. Your builder should be accessible, responsive, and transparent throughout the process.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Who will be my primary contact?
- How often will we meet during construction?
- How do you handle change orders?
- What project management tools do you use?

**What to Look For:**
- Clear communication protocols
- Regular progress updates
- Responsive to calls and emails
- Transparent about challenges

### Quality Standards

A builder's commitment to quality shows in every detail of their homes. Visit completed projects and homes under construction to assess their standards.

**Questions to Ask:**
- What quality control processes do you use?
- Who are your primary subcontractors?
- How do you handle warranty issues?
- What energy efficiency standards do you meet?

**What to Look For:**
- Clean, organized job sites
- Attention to detail in finishes
- Long-term relationships with subcontractors
- Willingness to exceed code requirements

## The Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Research and Shortlist

Start by identifying 3-5 builders who specialize in custom homes in your target area and price range.

**Research Sources:**
- Local home builders association
- Community recommendations
- Architect referrals
- Online reviews and portfolios
- Parade of Homes participants

### Step 2: Initial Interviews

Meet with each builder to discuss your project and assess fit. This initial conversation reveals a lot about how they work.

**Discussion Topics:**
- Your vision and requirements
- Their experience with similar projects
- General timeline and process
- Preliminary budget discussion
- Communication expectations

**Evaluate:**
- Do they listen more than they talk?
- Are they enthusiastic about your project?
- Do they ask thoughtful questions?
- Are they honest about challenges?

### Step 3: Reference Checks

Speaking with past clients is essential. A good builder will happily provide references and encourage you to visit completed homes.

**Questions for References:**
- Would you build with this builder again?
- How did they handle problems or changes?
- Was the project completed on time and budget?
- How is the home holding up?
- How responsive are they to warranty issues?

**What to Listen For:**
- Enthusiasm vs. hesitation
- Specific examples of problem-solving
- Comments about communication
- Overall satisfaction level

### Step 4: Site Visits

Visit both completed homes and active construction sites. What you see tells you more than any conversation.

**At Completed Homes:**
- Quality of finishes and details
- How the home has aged
- Craftsmanship in cabinetry and trim
- Window and door operation
- Overall feel and livability

**At Construction Sites:**
- Cleanliness and organization
- Safety practices
- Material storage and protection
- Worker professionalism
- Progress relative to schedule

### Step 5: Proposal Review

Once you've narrowed to 2-3 builders, request detailed proposals for your project. Compare them carefully.

**Proposal Should Include:**
- Detailed scope of work
- Allowances for selections
- Payment schedule
- Timeline
- Warranty terms
- Change order process

**Compare:**
- Are allowances realistic?
- What's included vs. excluded?
- How are contingencies handled?
- What are the payment terms?

## Contract Essentials

### Key Contract Terms

Your contract protects both you and the builder. Make sure these elements are clearly defined.

- Payment schedule tied to milestones
- Change order process and pricing
- Timeline with completion date
- Warranty terms and duration
- Dispute resolution process
- Insurance requirements

### Payment Structures

Understand how you'll pay for your home and what protections you have.

- More flexibility for changes
- Requires trust and transparency
- May result in lower or higher cost

**Hybrid:**
- Fixed price for structure
- Cost plus for finishes
- Balances certainty and flexibility

### Warranty Coverage

A good warranty protects your investment. Understand what's covered and for how long.

**Typical Coverage:**
- 1 year: Workmanship and materials
- 2 years: Mechanical systems
- 10 years: Structural defects

**Questions to Ask:**
- What's the warranty claim process?
- Who handles warranty work?
- Are there any exclusions?
