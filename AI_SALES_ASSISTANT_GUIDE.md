Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share some insights about building in Central Oregon that you might find interesting:

🏔️ Did you know? Central Oregon receives over 300 days of sunshine per year, making it ideal for homes with large windows and indoor-outdoor living spaces.

🏠 The high desert climate requires specialized building techniques - something we've perfected over 45+ years.

📈 Property values in communities like Brasada Ranch and Tetherow have consistently appreciated, making custom homes an excellent investment.

I've attached some stunning images of recent projects that showcase how we design homes to take advantage of our unique environment.

Would you like to schedule a call to discuss your vision?
