The marketing admin dashboard is working. Key observations:

   - Successfully generated article: "Crafting Your Dream: Brasada Ranch Custom Home Design Ideas with Kevin Rea"
   - Article is published and visible in the Articles tab
   - Bot shows 1 article generated, 3 completed tasks

2. Bot Activity Log shows:
   - Content Generation completed at 12:02:01 PM
   - Previous failed attempt at 12:00:37 PM (database column length issue - now fixed)
   - In-progress task at 12:01:48 PM

3. Dashboard Stats:
   - Total Leads: 1 (1 new)
   - Articles: 1 (1 published)
   - Total Views: 0
   - CTA Clicks: 0
   - Bot Tasks: 8 (3 completed)
   - Reach: 0

The system is working correctly. The earlier failure was due to metaDescription column being too short (160 chars) - this has been fixed to 500 chars.
