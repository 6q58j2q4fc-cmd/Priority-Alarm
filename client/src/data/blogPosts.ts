    excerpt: "Building in Central Oregon's high desert requires specialized knowledge and experience. Learn about the unique considerations for custom home construction in this beautiful but challenging environment.",
    content: `
## Understanding the High Desert Environment

The Oregon high desert presents unique opportunities and challenges for custom home builders. With over 300 days of sunshine, dramatic temperature swings, and an arid climate, building here requires specialized knowledge that only comes from decades of experience.

## Climate Considerations

Central Oregon's climate is characterized by:

- **Temperature Extremes**: Summer highs can reach 100°F while winter lows drop below zero
- **Low Humidity**: The dry air affects everything from wood shrinkage to HVAC design
- **Intense Sun**: UV exposure is significant at our elevation of 3,600+ feet
- **Snow Loads**: Winter storms can dump significant snow, requiring proper roof engineering

## Foundation and Structure

The volcanic soil and rock formations common in Central Oregon require careful site analysis and foundation design. Many sites feature basalt rock just below the surface, which can impact excavation costs but provides an excellent foundation base. Proper soil testing and engineering are essential first steps in any project.

## Energy Efficiency in the High Desert

The extreme temperature variations make energy efficiency paramount. Key considerations include:

- **Superior Insulation**: We typically exceed code requirements for wall and ceiling insulation
- **High-Performance Windows**: Triple-pane windows with low-E coatings are standard
- **Thermal Mass**: Strategic use of concrete and stone helps moderate temperature swings
- **Passive Solar Design**: Orienting homes to capture winter sun while providing summer shade

## Material Selection

Not all building materials perform well in the high desert. We've learned through experience which products stand up to our unique conditions:

- **Exterior Finishes**: Stucco, stone, and fiber cement siding outperform wood in our climate
- **Roofing**: Metal roofing handles snow loads and temperature cycling better than asphalt
- **Decking**: Composite decking resists UV damage and doesn't splinter like wood

## Water Management

Despite low rainfall, water management is critical. Proper grading, drainage systems, and waterproofing protect your investment from the occasional heavy rain or rapid snowmelt.

## The Rea Co Homes Advantage

With over 45 years of building in Central Oregon, Kevin Rea has developed relationships with the best local subcontractors and suppliers who understand high desert construction. This experience translates to homes that perform beautifully for decades.
